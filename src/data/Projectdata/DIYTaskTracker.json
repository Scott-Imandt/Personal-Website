Every time the car object is updated with new mileage and date-time information, the function calcMaintenance is called. This function handles the logic calculation of updating each job with new state information. Jobs can be created using preset defaults as well as user-specified jobs.",

The completed jobs object implements Comparable in order to print jobs in order from most recent to least recent date completed.

If a recurring job requires maintenance when printed to PDF, this job will be highlighted in red. The PDF prints Job Name, Mileage Interval, Month Interval, Last Date Performed, Expected Date to Perform, Last Performed Miles, Job Type, Reason for Repair, and Maintenance Needed.",
